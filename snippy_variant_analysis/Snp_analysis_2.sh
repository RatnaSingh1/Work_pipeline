# this script use to compare the snps.tab from each folder to get list of genes that are unique and common in samples â€“ output snp_comparison_summary
#First Count (Count in the otput file): represents the total number of mutations (or occurrences of a particular Product) in all the samples (folders). Each instance of a mutation #across samples is counted, irrespective of whether it appears in the same or different folders.
#Second Count (Sample_Count in the output file): This represents the number of unique samples (folders) in which a specific mutation (Product) is present. It shows how widespread a #mutation is across the samples.
